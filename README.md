## WebScraping Pseudocode
 I go to foothillsanimalshelter.org
 I click on "Adopt", which redirects me to the '/services/adopt/' page
 I click on "Adopt a Dog"
 Once all of the h3 elements have loaded, I scrape the names of each dog that is available for adoption
 I save the names as strings in an array titled "names"
